# [X] Classes
Back-End Exercise, Nashville Software School

## Instructions

- [X] Create a class (Employee) that contains information about employees of a company and define methods to get/set employee name, job title, and start date.

- [X] Consider the concept of [aggregation](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/bangazon-ltd/blob/master/orientation/FND_14_INHERIT_COMPOSE_AGGREGATE.md). 
    - AGGREGATION is for adding objects that are needed for the operation of another object, but should exist independently of it should it be destroyed. Aggregation is the pattern for has-a relationships.
    - COMPOSITION is for things that make up other things. If the container object is destroyed, so will all of its composing parts. Composition is the pattern for part-of relationships.
    - INHERITANCE is for straightforward "is-a" relationship (ie a baseball is a ball, a skyscaper is a building).

- [X] Modify the `Company` class so that you assign employees to a company.

- [X] Create a company, and three employees, and then assign the employees to the company.
